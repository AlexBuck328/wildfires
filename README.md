# Patterns of Destruction: Exploring Wildfires from 1878 to 2019

### Purpose

Wildfires are becoming more destructive. Data shows an increasing trend in acreage burned per year. This increase also drives up the annual cost to control these destructive forces. The [Congressional Research Service](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/IF10244.pdf) calculated the impact of wildland fires over the past decade (2011-2020). An average of 62,693 wildland fires annually, impacting 7.5 million acres annually are impacted by these fires. Although the majority of wildland fires occur in undeveloped areas which have little impact on communities or human development, these fires do occur mostly on federal lands (roughly 65%). Federal lands are land that is held in trust by the federal government, which is for the enjoyment of all Americans. 

While wildfires may not directly impact your residence (they do for some people) they do impact land that you as an American are entilted to recreate on. If you've ever been to one of the many national parks in the western part of the country, you've likely seen the effects of wildland fires.
